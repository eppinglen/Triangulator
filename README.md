# Triangulator

This is the repo for the JPIAMR 2019 Hackathon triangulator project by Chantal, Vendela, Sumeet, Lennard, and David.

## Setup

As a convenience, the Makefile takes simple tasks like installing and backing up the environment of your hands.
`make setup.env` sets up the environment from the .yml file, `make setup.save` backs up your currently installed packages into the .yml file, commits the change, and pushes.

## Getting data

To come.
